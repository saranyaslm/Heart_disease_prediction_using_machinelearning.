# Heart disease prediction using machine learning

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning, specifically the logistic regression algorithm. By analyzing a dataset containing various patient attributes such as age, sex, and cholesterol levels, the model aims to identify patterns that correlate with the presence or absence of heart disease. Through this analysis, the project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting heart disease risk factors, contributing to the field of cardiovascular health management.








## Installation

Install my-project with

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install pillow
pip install streamlit
```
    
## Roadmap

- Data pre processing 

- train and test split using logistic regression model


finally get the output defective heart or healthy heart
## Run Locally



```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
